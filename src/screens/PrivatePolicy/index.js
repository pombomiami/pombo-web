          User Content the metadata can describe how, when, where, and by whom
          the piece of User Content was created, collected, or modified and how
          that content is formatted. It also includes information, such as your
          account name, that enables other users to trace back the User Content
          to your user account. Additionally, metadata includes data that you
          choose to provide with your User Content, e.g. any hashtags used to
          mark keywords to the video and captions.
